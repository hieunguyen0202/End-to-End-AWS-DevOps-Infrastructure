üìò DevOps Project Documentation

I. Project Overview
- Project Name: End to End AWS DevOps Infrastructure

- Objective: Automate the build, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning of a Java-based 3-tier web application using CI/CD pipelines and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

- Key values:
    - Streamlined CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins + Helm) across DEV/UAT/PRE-PROD environments to automate build, deploy, vulnerability scanning, packaging, alerting, reporting, and backup tasks ‚Äî reducing manual workload by 60%. Improved deployment speed and reduced image size by 80% through lightweight base images, caching strategies.

    - Deployed and configured CI/CD systems onsite at the client environment, setting up Helm, Quay.io authentication, and pipeline integration to enable secure. Guided CIMB release teams on CI/CD and DevSecOps best practices.

    - Enhanced CI/CD security by integrating SonarQube, Snyk, and Trivy ‚Äî reducing vulnerabilities by 70% and improving overall code quality. Followed Helm best practices to mitigate security risks during client deployment audits.
    
    - Implemented observability stack with OpenTelemetry (Tempo, Loki, Prometheus, Grafana) to monitor pod performance, resource usage, and request latency. Integrated with Kubernetes HPA policies to auto-scale workloads based on real-time metrics, ensuring high system availability and maintaining SLA uptime of 99.95%.
    
    - Reduced delivery time by 60% by packaging applications as Helm Charts with clear release tags and documentation, enabling easier version tracking, rollback, and streamlined delivery management for both developers and clients.

- Tech Stack: GitHub Actions, Terraform, Docker, ECS, ECR, SonarCloud, JFrog, RDS (MySQL), Amazon MQ, ElastiCache (Memcached), CloudWatch, CloudFront, ALB, Nginx, Tomcat, Maven.

IV. Module Documentation

1. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
üîπ Overview

This pipeline automates build, code scanning, artifact management, image building, security scanning, and deployment to ECS and Nginx.

üî∏ Workflow Steps:

Backend (Java):

- Checkout source code from GitHub
- Run SonarCloud scan
- Build with Maven
- Push artifacts to JFrog Artifactory
- Build Docker image
- Scan image with Trivy
- Push to AWS ECR
- Deploy image to ECS

Frontend (Static):

- Checkout frontend code
- Build static files (React/Angular/etc.)
- Copy build output to Nginx EC2 server via SSH or deploy with S3 + CloudFront
