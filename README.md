I. Project Overview
- Project Name: End to End AWS DevOps Infrastructure

- Objective: Automate the build, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning of a Java-based 3-tier web application using CI/CD pipelines and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

- Key values:
    - Streamlined CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins + Helm) across DEV/UAT/PRE-PROD environments to automate build, deploy, vulnerability scanning, packaging, alerting, reporting, and backup tasks ‚Äî reducing manual workload by 60%. Improved deployment speed and reduced image size by 80% through lightweight base images, caching strategies.

    - Deployed and configured CI/CD systems onsite at the client environment, setting up Helm, Quay.io authentication, and pipeline integration to enable secure. Guided CIMB release teams on CI/CD and DevSecOps best practices.

    - Enhanced CI/CD security by integrating SonarQube, Snyk, and Trivy ‚Äî reducing vulnerabilities by 70% and improving overall code quality. Followed Helm best practices to mitigate security risks during client deployment audits.
    
    - Implemented observability stack with OpenTelemetry (Tempo, Loki, Prometheus, Grafana) to monitor pod performance, resource usage, and request latency. Integrated with Kubernetes HPA policies to auto-scale workloads based on real-time metrics, ensuring high system availability and maintaining SLA uptime of 99.95%.
    
    - Reduced delivery time by 60% by packaging applications as Helm Charts with clear release tags and documentation, enabling easier version tracking, rollback, and streamlined delivery management for both developers and clients.

- Tech Stack: GitHub Actions, Terraform, Docker, ECS, ECR, SonarCloud, JFrog, RDS (MySQL), Amazon MQ, ElastiCache (Memcached), CloudWatch, CloudFront, ALB, Nginx, Tomcat, Maven.

üîπ Frontend & Network Entry
- CloudFront: Acts as a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to cache and distribute content globally, reducing latency and improving performance for users.
- Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic across multiple instances in the Auto Scaling Group to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
- Internet Gateway: Allows communication between instances in the public subnet and the internet.

üîπ Networking & Routing
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Isolates and controls network settings for all resources, enhancing security.
- Public Subnets: Host internet-facing resources like the ALB and NAT Gateway.
- Private Subnets: Host backend services like application servers, databases, MQ, and caching, not directly exposed to the internet.
- Route Tables: Manage routing between subnets, S3, and the internet.
- NAT Gateway: Allows instances in the private subnet to access the internet (e.g., to download updates) without exposing them directly.
- S3 Gateway Endpoint: Enables private network access to Amazon S3 without using the Internet Gateway, improving security and reducing data transfer costs.

üîπ Compute Layer
- Auto Scaling Group (ASG): Automatically adds/removes EC2 instances based on demand, ensuring scalability and high availability of the application layer.

üîπ Application Integration
- Amazon MQ: Managed message broker (e.g., ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ) used to decouple application components and manage asynchronous communication.

- Memcached (Amazon ElastiCache): Provides in-memory data caching to reduce database load and increase application performance.

üîπ Data Storage
- Amazon RDS: Managed relational database service used to store application data (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) with high availability and automated backups.

- Amazon S3: Object storage for storing static assets, backups, deployment artifacts, logs, and other large files.

üîπ Monitoring & Alerting
- Amazon CloudWatch: Monitors logs, metrics, and events; used to trigger alarms based on defined thresholds.
- CloudWatch Alarms: Watch specific metrics and trigger actions (e.g., scale out or send notifications).
- SNS Topic (Simple Notification Service): Sends alerts via email, SMS, or other protocols when an alarm is triggered (e.g., CPU usage exceeds threshold).

üîπ Security
- Security Groups: Acts as virtual firewalls for controlling inbound/outbound traffic for EC2, ALB, Amazon MQ, and RDS.

# Implement Plan
