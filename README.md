# Application Overview

ðŸ”¹ Frontend & Network Entry
- CloudFront: Acts as a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to cache and distribute content globally, reducing latency and improving performance for users.
- Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic across multiple instances in the Auto Scaling Group to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
- Internet Gateway: Allows communication between instances in the public subnet and the internet.

ðŸ”¹ Networking & Routing
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Isolates and controls network settings for all resources, enhancing security.
- Public Subnets: Host internet-facing resources like the ALB and NAT Gateway.
- Private Subnets: Host backend services like application servers, databases, MQ, and caching, not directly exposed to the internet.
- Route Tables: Manage routing between subnets, S3, and the internet.
- NAT Gateway: Allows instances in the private subnet to access the internet (e.g., to download updates) without exposing them directly.
- S3 Gateway Endpoint: Enables private network access to Amazon S3 without using the Internet Gateway, improving security and reducing data transfer costs.

ðŸ”¹ Compute Layer
- Auto Scaling Group (ASG): Automatically adds/removes EC2 instances based on demand, ensuring scalability and high availability of the application layer.

ðŸ”¹ Application Integration
- Amazon MQ: Managed message broker (e.g., ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ) used to decouple application components and manage asynchronous communication.

- Memcached (Amazon ElastiCache): Provides in-memory data caching to reduce database load and increase application performance.

ðŸ”¹ Data Storage
- Amazon RDS: Managed relational database service used to store application data (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) with high availability and automated backups.

- Amazon S3: Object storage for storing static assets, backups, deployment artifacts, logs, and other large files.

ðŸ”¹ Monitoring & Alerting
- Amazon CloudWatch: Monitors logs, metrics, and events; used to trigger alarms based on defined thresholds.
- CloudWatch Alarms: Watch specific metrics and trigger actions (e.g., scale out or send notifications).
- SNS Topic (Simple Notification Service): Sends alerts via email, SMS, or other protocols when an alarm is triggered (e.g., CPU usage exceeds threshold).

ðŸ”¹ Security
- Security Groups: Acts as virtual firewalls for controlling inbound/outbound traffic for EC2, ALB, Amazon MQ, and RDS.

# Implement Plan

## Step 1: Automate IaC with Terraform

## Setup Terraform Environment with diffent stage and S3 backend storage

- You need to have own AWS account and billing enable
- Create IAM user with name `AWS-Infra-03-IAM-User` and grant role below
    - AmazonS3FullAccess
    - AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess
    - AmazonVPCFullAccess
    - AmazonEC2FullAccess
    - SecretsManagerReadWrite
    - AmazonRDSFullAccess
    - IAMFullAccess
    - AdministratorAccess-AWSElasticBeanstalk
    - AWSCertificateManagerFullAccess


- Go to AWS Console and create new Bucket Name `aws-infra-03-terraform-state`

- Next step, you need to create `Access Key` for this user, so we can use it for auth with Github Action
    - Access key: ``
    - Secret access key: ``

- You need to create secret environment in Github, choose `New repository secret`
    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
